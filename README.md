# Data-Mining-Project
# Authors: Manuel Carreiras and Ven√¢ncio Munhangane

In this project we were challenged to analyze a dataset provided by the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), consisting of a sample of the results of one of its recent fundraising appeals, in order to develop a customer segmentation to help PVA understand and forecast donors behaviour and perceive potential donation opportunities, producing a marketing report. This customer segmentation is made by separating the donors into groups (clusters) based on the characteristics they share. This report intends to go through all the process and reasoning behind the decisions made both on the data cleaning and preprocessing and on the clusters definition and interpretation; ending with the marketing approach recommended for each cluster defined.
