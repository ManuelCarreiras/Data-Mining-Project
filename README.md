# Context
This dataset was provided by the Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA). PVA is a non-profit
organization that provides programs and services for US veterans with spinal cord injuries or disease.
With an in-house database of 13 million donors, PVA is also one of the largest direct mail fundraisers in
the United States of America.
The task is to analyze a sample of the results of one of PVA's recent fundraising appeals, containing 95
412 donors. This mailing was sent to a total of 3.5 million PVA donors who were on the PVA database.
Everyone included in this database made at least one prior donation to PVA.
